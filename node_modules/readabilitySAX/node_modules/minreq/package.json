  "readme": "#minreq\nA minimalistic request library for node.\n\n##How?\n    npm install minreq\n\n##Why?\n\nThe most common library used to perform http(s)-requests in node is [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request). While it works, it has a lot of features that aren't needed in most cases (eg. cookies, oauth). Besides, the code isn't as fast as it can be. This project is intended to replace `request` in cases where it's simply too heavy.\n\n##What?\n###Features\n* `request` like api\n* lightweight (compared to this lib, `request` is a giant)\n* provides a callback that's called when a response was received (like request)\n* works as a stream (`Stream#pipe` is supported)\n* forwards events\n* follows redirects\n* you may add your own protocols!\n\n###Options\n* `uri`: Object that's passed to http(s).request ([as described here](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#http.request))\n* `followRedirect`: Boolean that indicates whether redirects should be followed\n* `maxRedirects`: int with the maximum number of redirects (defaults to 10)\n* `body`: that data that should be passed to the request\n* `encoding`: the encoding that all data should use (the body will always be a string)\n* `timeout`: a request times out if it passes this limit. Defaults to 10000 (read: 10 seconds)\n* `only2xx`: only permit status codes >= 200 and < 300 (otherwise, throw an error)\n\n-\n\nLicense: Public domain",
